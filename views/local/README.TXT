This folder is where you can put your customized html encoded views for WP-CollectiveAccess.

Copy a view from WP-CollectiveAccess inside this directory and adapt it. You can keep here your views with this naming convention :
- collectiveaccess_browse_html.php : default view for all themes
- collectiveaccess_browse_html__twentyfourteen : view adapted for a theme, will override collectiveaccess_browse_html.php if present (note the double __ between the view and the theme)

CSS and JS files naming have to follow same rules
- collectiveaccess_browse_css.php : default css for all themes
- collectiveaccess_browse_css__twentyfourteen : css adapted for a single theme
- collectiveaccess_browse_js.php : default js for all themes
- collectiveaccess_browse_js__twentyfourteen : js adapted for a single theme
